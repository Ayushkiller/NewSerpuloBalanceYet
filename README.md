### English is not my native laungage, and in most times I will use translator. Feel free to DM me (blackberry2093, aka Blackberry) if you have any questions! Before to say anything about rebalance, test it yourself (or check documentation and video atleast)! This rebalance was designed to improve gameplay with minimum changes (I reworked stats for turrets, units and few other blocks. I didnt touched economic part, so it wont break schemes, improving gameplay by fixing units-turrets only). Before reading READ.me, check this:

(Mod designed to be tested on v149)
A rebalance that changes the stats of units, turrets, and several additional blocks without changing or affecting the eco-production factories (that is, changes aimed purely at the attacking and defensing gameplay). Rebalancing is needed in order to fix both local (meta units, such as flares and zeniths, as well as broken naval tree, and more) with minimal changes; meta turrets, like swarmers and cyclones), and complex (meta mobility, which is the reason for the uselessness of almost all ground units, and overrange, for example omure and corvus (fortresses do not count due to too strong swarmers and low mobility). Rebalance mod designed to improve all gamemods, without breaking campaign or making new issues (btw it should improve campaign too, but I will be honest, rebalance was made from professional player to everyone, so it would request more tests to be sure it doesn't break anything in campaign sectors)
